      <h2>From A Tale of Two Cities - By Charles Dickens</h2>
      <p>It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of
      wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was
      the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of
      Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, we had
      everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct to
      Heaven, we were all going direct the other way - in short, the period was so
      far like the present period, that some of its noisiest authorities insisted
      on its being received, for good or for evil, in the superlative degree of
      comparison only</p>
